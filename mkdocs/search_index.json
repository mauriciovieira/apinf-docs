If everything is monochromic color, he might lost the things that needs his attention. \nVisual alert is more effective.\n\n\nThe Participant needs a dashboard not only to see brief information but also to get alerts and be alerted.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: what about the information about percentage increase/decrease in value of the metrics defined?\n\n- That would depend on the threshold set. If the Participant clicks a specific metric card, then he expects to see a dialogue showing him that metric in a time graph.\n- the indications are good. it can be use case for other API owners, but not for him. \nthe indications should be color coded to notify whch is a positive change and which is not. \nThat should differe based on the type of metric user is viewing.\n\n\nQuestion 3: what is your preference period of time to see the data in the dashboard?\n\n- For the participant, it is more relevant to show data is updated in 5 minutes or less. (as real time or possible)\n- For monitoring purpose, real time data is more important.\n- agrregrated information (monthly/weekly) is more appropriate for \"good to know\" purposes.Its better for presentation\n\n\nQuestion 4: what is your idea about data refreshing?\n\n- Refreshing and the repopulation of data should be information not older than 2 minute.\nfor weekly purpose: from now until the same time in past week.\n\n\nQuestion 5: what do you think happens when you touch a card here?\n\n- on clicking a card, it gives the participant a detailed overview\n(we switched into the second wireframe)\n- a new dialogue, not a new page. Because page would loose all the context for the user\n- a dialogue makes more sense, because participant stays in the same context and \nthere is no need to repopulate all the data that needs to be done when navigating to a new page.\nThis reduces redundant development and system calls to fetch the data.\n\n\nQuestion 6: what about the detailed overview shown there?\n\n- about detailed charts, for weekly purpose (example), participant would be expecting to return some more data apart from the (x to x+7 days) to get some peak into the next step.\n- Participant may want to be navigated to a different page, when he has drilled down some particular information (e.g. average response time, when it was on peak during to period x tp x+7) about a specific API, to get more details.\n\n\nQuestion 7: what about refreshing in detailed view?\n\n- Refresh should fetch the most recent data. If the participant was in detailed view 10 seconds earlier, he would expect to get weekly data from the current time to x+7 days.\nHe wants to get the data the last time it was updated.\n\n\nQuestion 8: what you like about the (1st wireframe)? Are the shown information enough to know about your APi statuses?\n\n- it depends on usecases. For example, unique user may be needed for a specific API only. For other APIs, unique users may be of no use.\n- it may me useful for the participant to see number of calls and average response time based on endpoints of a specific API.\n- in a generalized perspective, No. of calls and average response time are the only two metrics which is important for the participant for all the APIs he owns. increase or decrease in the amount may be interesting.\n\n\nQuestion 9: what improvements would you like to see there (1st wireframe)?\n\n- manual configuration of metrics as per every API (e.g. seeing average response time of the same API with three different endpoints,\n- endpoints are very important  for the participnat. (because access to an endpoint might be done via different paths by different users)\n\n\nQuestion 10: what you like about the (2nd wireframe)? Are the shown information enough to know about your APi statuses?\n\n- yes, may be.\n\n\nQuestion 10: what improvements would you like to see there (2nd wireframe)?\n\n- Participant were not clear about how the week view works. He assumed that he can select any of the 252 weeks in the year. \n- He was uncertain if the refresh shows information from the last day to the past week or current time to same time last week.\n- He suggested for a date picker where he can configure a specific week with start and end dates to see the data\n- For the participant, real time data is more important than weekly data because he treats weekly data as \"good-to-know\" information.\n\n\nQuestion 11: What is your feedback about (2nd version of) Dashboard Overview?\n\n- Participant preferred the former version as numbers were visible and big enough to draw the attention.\n- The 1st version would be easier to develop as responsive UI.\n- Participant might like to use the trend lines, but that is secondary.\n- Participant is not in the favor of having icons associated with specific metrics. (e.g. he pointed out a phone receiver with API calls\nwhere the usual case, it is not a phone call). He is concerned with the correctness of the metaphore. He'd prefer Text only naming and descriptions of metrics/elements as there may arise to complexity of choosing metaphorically correct icons.\n- Participant favors other way of highlighting an API that needs attention. If only red/yellow bullets are used, this might skip \nhis attention or he may ignore it altogether.",

Participant assumes he can manually configure overview information that would be appearing for each APIs. \n(e.g. selecting No. of calls, Avg. response time, unique users, etc. for 1 API; selecting only the 1st 2 briefs for another, etc.)   Question 2: Where you can configure which cards to appear in dashboard   Participant is looking for a configuration button somewhere in the API name dropdown.  Participant wishes to look for threshold values to compare against a specific metric (especially for avg. response time).  Participant expects if any of the metric values exceeds some predefined threshold, there should be visual cue to indicate it.\n(alternatives: alert, email, audible alert, etc.). If everything is monochromic color, he might lost the things that needs his attention. \nVisual alert is more effective.  The Participant needs a dashboard not only to see brief information but also to get alerts and be alerted.   Question 3: what about the information about percentage increase/decrease in value of the metrics defined? \n- That would depend on the threshold set. If the Participant clicks a specific metric card, then he expects to see a dialogue showing him that metric in a time graph.\n- the indications are good. it can be use case for other API owners, but not for him. \nthe indications should be color coded to notify whch is a positive change and which is not. \nThat should differe based on the type of metric user is viewing.  Question 3: what is your preference period of time to see the data in the dashboard? \n- For the participant, it is more relevant to show data is updated in 5 minutes or less. (as real time or possible)\n- For monitoring purpose, real time data is more important.\n- agrregrated information (monthly/weekly) is more appropriate for \"good to know\" purposes.Its better for presentation  Question 4: what is your idea about data refreshing? \n- Refreshing and the repopulation of data should be information not older than 2 minute.\nfor weekly purpose: from now until the same time in past week.  Question 5: what do you think happens when you touch a card here? \n- on clicking a card, it gives the participant a detailed overview\n(we switched into the second wireframe)\n- a new dialogue, not a new page. Because page would loose all the context for the user\n- a dialogue makes more sense, because participant stays in the same context and \nthere is no need to repopulate all the data that needs to be done when navigating to a new page.\nThis reduces redundant development and system calls to fetch the data.  Question 6: what about the detailed overview shown there? \n- about detailed charts, for weekly purpose (example), participant would be expecting to return some more data apart from the (x to x+7 days) to get some peak into the next step.\n- Participant may want to be navigated to a different page, when he has drilled down some particular information (e.g. average response time, when it was on peak during to period x tp x+7) about a specific API, to get more details.  Question 7: what about refreshing in detailed view? \n- Refresh should fetch the most recent data. If the participant was in detailed view 10 seconds earlier, he would expect to get weekly data from the current time to x+7 days.\nHe wants to get the data the last time it was updated.  Question 8: what you like about the (1st wireframe)? Are the shown information enough to know about your APi statuses? \n- it depends on usecases. For example, unique user may be needed for a specific API only. For other APIs, unique users may be of no use.\n- it may me useful for the participant to see number of calls and average response time based on endpoints of a specific API.\n- in a generalized perspective, No. of calls and average response time are the only two metrics which is important for the participant for all the APIs he owns. increase or decrease in the amount may be interesting.  Question 9: what improvements would you like to see there (1st wireframe)? \n- manual configuration of metrics as per every API (e.g. seeing average response time of the same API with three different endpoints,\n- endpoints are very important  for the participnat. (because access to an endpoint might be done via different paths by different users)  Question 10: what you like about the (2nd wireframe)? Are the shown information enough to know about your APi statuses? \n- yes, may be.  Question 10: what improvements would you like to see there (2nd wireframe)? \n- Participant were not clear about how the week view works. He assumed that he can select any of the 252 weeks in the year. \n- He was uncertain if the refresh shows information from the last day to the past week or current time to same time last week.\n- He suggested for a date picker where he can configure a specific week with start and end dates to see the data\n- For the participant, real time data is more important than weekly data because he treats weekly data as \"good-to-know\" information.  Question 11: What is your feedback about (2nd version of) Dashboard Overview? \n- Participant preferred the former version as numbers were visible and big enough to draw the attention.\n- The 1st version would be easier to develop as responsive UI.\n- Participant might like to use the trend lines, but that is secondary.\n- Participant is not in the favor of having icons associated with specific metrics. (e.g. he pointed out a phone receiver with API calls\nwhere the usual case, it is not a phone call). He is concerned with the correctness of the metaphore. He'd prefer Text only naming and descriptions of metrics/elements as there may arise to complexity of choosing metaphorically correct icons.\n- Participant favors other way of highlighting an API that needs attention. If only red/yellow bullets are used, this might skip \nhis attention or he may ignore it altogether.",

Authentication and access control are implemented by various emqttd plugins. emqttd_plugin_postgres and emqttd_plugin_mongo are good candidates.\n We can store the client ids, passwords and acls in one of these databases and use the plugins directly.  On Apinf side, we need to create a dashboard where a user can register their client ids, and control acls for their devices.\n Changes made here must be propogated to the database. All writes happen from here, emqttd only reads this information.",

Working agreements are a set of rules or processes the team identifies and formulates together and agrees to follow to become more efficient as a team.\n\n\nFirstly, we had individual brainstorming to gather insights on issues (both positive ad negative) related to past/current team cooperation. The insights were gathered on sticky notes. Each team member presented their post-it notes, which were then grouped to 6 groups.

Working agreements are a set of rules or processes the team identifies and formulates together and agrees to follow to become more efficient as a team.  Firstly, we had individual brainstorming to gather insights on issues (both positive ad negative) related to past/current team cooperation. The insights were gathered on sticky notes. Each team member presented their post-it notes, which were then grouped to 6 groups. We started working on the most popular groups, used dot voting to identify the most important issues. Based on the findings, we formulated 5 working agreements.  Our set of working agreements  Emphasize teamwork by daily pair programming and task splitting.  Participate in sprint pre-planning at least once a month.  Keep meetings brief and relevant.  Communicate task progress on daily basis by updating time estimates and linking PR's and commits.  Always review others' work thoroughly.  List of sticky notes collected in the exercise  Collaboration   Pair programming  Working in pairs sharing tasks  Pre-planning needs more team involvement  standups  Laughs and jokes during the day > we have a good spritit  Handling conflicts   Long standups Peer review    reviews   commits  updating task status on Waffle  Keeping tasks updated regularly   Commenting issues/progress in  tasks (Waffle) Working space    Tight working space.

(See README file for elastic-rest). \nAlso added changes to meteor methods at Apinf related to package modifications. \n\n\nTo be considered: moving the repository to Apinf Github organization\n\n\n\n\nLaura\n\n\n#578 Invalid redirects to Privacy policy and Terms of use\n\n\n\n\nLaura has checked a few privacy policies and also the Sampo privacy policy.

We can maintain a change file in the repository and use the changes list as material for creating release notes.\nStill requires decision about which Github labels to use for which issues and how so that issues become correctly listed in the \nchangelog files for example as bugs, enhancements.\n\n\n2160: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2160\n\n\nIf a user expression fails, there was an error on UI informing the user about REGex failing. This was too uninformative and did not help\nthe user to correct the error. Illya created more user friendly and localisable error messages, for example \"Must be a valid email\". \nFor the APInf specific texts like front-end paths, the error also lists allowed characters.\n\n\n2162: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2162\n\n\nIllya studied and experimented with the data available from API Umbrella analytics through Elastic Search. There is now a document\ndescribing Elastic Search data structure. The conclusion was that API key data is available through Elastic Search and that it would be \nfor example possible to build a user-specific dashboard based on API key usage.\n\n\nDocument can be found from APInf docs repository: https://github.com/apinf/docs/blob/master/docs/develop/Integration/Elasticsearch-data-structure.md\n\n\n2191: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2191\n\n\nEvery source file starts with copyright and license information, except for files we have taken into use and not modified (e.g. libraries), which \nkeep the original copyright.\n\n\n8: https://github.com/apinf/apinf.github.io/issues/8\n\n\nIllya described the (manual) deployment steps for the webpage.\n\n\nBrylie\n\n\n2302: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2302\n\n\nBrylie is creating a system model diagram of APInf along with the API Umbrella proxy and the eMQ broker. The diagram contains users, components\nand technologies.\n\n\nDiagram can be found from the issue, to be added to docs repository.\n\n\n2241: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2241\n\n\nBrylie has created a diagram that document the permissions for each user role: anonymous, authenticated, API manager, organization manager and admin.\n\n\nDiagram can be found from the issue, to be added to docs repository.\n\n\n2129: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2129\n\n\nBrylie has documented three different monitoring solutions. The purpose is to find a monitoring service that could be integrated with APInf and\nused for monitoring APIs. Minimum requirement is being able to monitor web services. Some of the additional requirements are admin API and analytics API, notification. Potentially there could also be an agent that runs in the API server (e.g. CPU load, network throughput). \n\n\nIf we are integrating this with APInf, it should also be fully open source.\n\n\nMonitoring document can be found from: https://github.com/apinf/docs/blob/master/docs/research/API_Monitoring_Service.md\n\n\nJawid\n\n\n1986: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/1986\n\n\nJawid has researched and experimented with options for capturing and tracking application exceptions.\n\n\nThis is work in progress, document not available in docs repository at the time of writing the minutes.\n\n\nMatti and Jawid\n\n\n2188: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2188\n\n\nOrganization manager can add media links to the organization page. The media content can be for example Youtube videos, events, blog posts,\ntweets. The link is presented as embedded content on the organization page. It could be used for example to promote events related to their API or\nblog posts about using their APIs or changes coming.\n\n\nNazia\n\n\n2178: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2178\n\n\nNazia has created design sketches and wireframes for front page redesign with mobile-first approach. The purpose is to include only the essential\nfunctionality and content on the front page.\n\n\n2117: https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2117\n\n\nNazia has created a new persona for API consumer with a scenario. The persona description can be found from the issue comments.\n\n\n41: https://github.com/apinf/open-api-designer/issues/41\n\n\nNazia arranged a usability test for open API designer for one first-time user.

It can also serve as a recruitment path, if we get regular, good quality contributions from a developer or several developers. It also allows us to solve issues for which we don't have the resources ourselves, when either the priority or urgency is not high enough. Or solve them before we would have time for them ourselves.\n\n\nAt first our goal would simply be to learn the process and to see if there any benefits of using the bountyprogram.\n\n\nCriteria for selecting tasks\n\n\nThe bounty tasks could be either \n\n small low hanging fruits to attract more developers and for them to get an initial understanding of APInf\n\n more complex, high priority tasks - a real (customer) need, but not urgently needed\n\n\nThey must be tasks for which we can define a clear deliverable. We should describe the task, estimate it to have an idea about the bounty sum and write a definition of done.\n\n\nService to be used\n\n\nBountysource\n is targeted for open source projects. It has over 38 000 community members and it's used by IBM, OwnCloud, Facebook. \n\n\nA registered user can add a Github issue to the service as a bounty task and backers can add a bounty sum for a task. It is possible to register a team in the service (roughly equivalent to Github organization).\n\n\nBountysource takes a 10% fee for withdrawing money from the service. There seems to be no fee for adding a bounty or paying for bounty.\n\n\nPromotion and outreach\n\n\nWe need to create a bounty label for Github and use it for tasks that have been added to the Bountysource service. Bounties should also be promoted. One option is to post automatically to Twitter every time a bounty label is added.\n\n\nInitial tasks\n\n\nHere are some ideas for potential first bounty tasks:\n\n https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/issues/38\n\n https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/2068\n\n https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/1786\n\n https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/1941\n* https://github.com/apinf/platform/issues/1102\n\n\nTracking and measuring impact\n\n\nWe should track at least the tweet about bounties and the click through using tinyURL.\n\n\nOther ideas for tracking?",

Hard find details (in opposite Prometheus documentation).\n\n\nUses a relation databases for store time series data (like MySQL).

But that make easy setup by Chef or Ansible.\n\n\n\n\nBased on pros and cons of both tool and target that was set by story/research \n\u201cStudy what monitoring service to be used\u201d\n, recommendation to use Prometheus as modern tool with good architecture (modules), great performance and \ngreat documentation\n.\n\n\nPrometheus is a open source monitoring system that includes built-in and active scraping, storing, querying, graphing, and alerting based on time series data. \n\n\nArchitecture\n: Prometheus servers run independently of each other and only rely on their local storage for their core functionality: scraping, rule processing, and alerting.\n\n\nData model\n: Most important aspects is its multi-dimensional data model (\nOpenTSDB\n) along with the accompanying query language. This allows easy filtering, grouping, and matching by these labels via in the query language.\n\n\nScalable\n: Hundreds of thousands of samples per second. Millions of time series. On a single monitoring server (running many servers is easy too).\n\n\nStorage\n: Prometheus own database optimized for time series data that can allow work with millions of time series.\n\n\nDiscovery\n: targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration (DNS, \nconsul\n, \nkubernetes\n, etc.).\n\n\nVisualization\n: multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support (\nGraphana\n, \nPromDash\n, etc.).\n\n\nAlerting\n: Separated into two parts. Alerting rules in Prometheus servers send alerts to an Alertmanager. The Alertmanager then manages those alerts, including silencing, inhibition, aggregation and sending out notifications via methods such as email, PagerDuty and Slack.\n\n\nClient libraries\n: Go, Java, Ruby, Python, Node.js, \netc\n.",

Prometheus is a open source monitoring system that includes built-in and active scraping, storing, querying, graphing, and alerting based on time series data.   Architecture : Prometheus servers run independently of each other and only rely on their local storage for their core functionality: scraping, rule processing, and alerting.  Data model : Most important aspects is its multi-dimensional data model ( OpenTSDB ) along with the accompanying query language. This allows easy filtering, grouping, and matching by these labels via in the query language.  Scalable : Hundreds of thousands of samples per second. Millions of time series. On a single monitoring server (running many servers is easy too).  Storage : Prometheus own database optimized for time series data that can allow work with millions of time series.  Discovery : targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration (DNS,  consul ,  kubernetes , etc.).  Visualization : multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support ( Graphana ,  PromDash , etc.).  Alerting : Separated into two parts. Alerting rules in Prometheus servers send alerts to an Alertmanager. The Alertmanager then manages those alerts, including silencing, inhibition, aggregation and sending out notifications via methods such as email, PagerDuty and Slack.  Client libraries : Go, Java, Ruby, Python, Node.js,  etc .",

            "location": "/research/DDoS-prevention/",
            "text": "DDoS attack\n\n\nDDoS attack is type of attack, which causes performance issue to a server, or sometimes it even causes a server to stop functioning. The victims of DDoS attacks are usually servers that provide inbound and outbound traffic. Also, interfaces that are involved in exchanging information throughout the Internet, can be the target of the attacks. \n\n\nA DDoS attack would effectively disable access to the API. As mobile app penetration and usage grows, and bank customers use apps as their main channel to perform banking transactions, the impact an API attack can have on an economy grows exponentially. Customers are unable to pay bills, transfer money, or ensure they have funds to make purchases. \n\n\n\u201dMy website has been experiencing a denial of service/hack attack for the last week. The attack is hitting our web API with randomly generated invalid API keys in a loop.\nI'm not sure if they are trying to guess a key (mathematically impossible as 64bit keys) or trying to DOS attack the server. The attack is distributed, so I cannot ban all of the IP address, as it occurs from hundreds of clients.\u201d case from stackoverflow.com\n\n\nHow to cope with brute force attack?\n\n\nA brute force attack simply uses cryptography algorithm. Using the algorithm the attackers made a program that automatically break into autentication systems. When we attempt to login and our page request is sent from the server to the client machine hackers are more active to access the account.\nThe standard way to do this is by implementing a lockout or a progressive delay. A lockout prevents an IP from making a login request for X minutes if they fail to log in N times. A progressive delay adds a longer and longer delay to processing each bad login request. \nCopin through some server-side preventions:\nSetting up an IDS system, like Snort, to detect when a DDOS attack is occurring and take the first steps to mitigate it\nInstalling and configuring a web-application firewall, like mod_security, to reject incoming connections that violate rules that you define.\nFail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication presents. \nIncrease the API key length to 128 (or 256, or 512) won't cost much, and you'll tremendously increase the search space \nIn case the application is deployed on cloud i.e, Amazon Web Services, it is possible to safegaurd the application with some services:\n- Use CloudFlare.\n- Consider using AWS API gateway as the second stage for your API requests. AWS API gateway provides filtering, throttling, security,auto-scaling and HA for your API. \n- And then forward the valid requests to your machines (in or outside amazon)\n\n\nDDoS attack can be launched from numerous compromised devices, often distributed globally in what is referred to as a botnet. Motives for these attacks appear equally diverse such as personal reasons, the prestige, criminal, commercial, or ideological in nature.\n People behind the DDoS attacks are:\n\n\nExtortionists: They menace to inactivate the web service and then ask for the ransom money to put a stop to an attack. \n\n\nExfiltrators: They use a DoS attack to distract interest from their actual aim \u2013 stealing data for money in a form of intellectual property or credit card numbers. \n\n\nHacktivists: They are different than rest of the opponents. They are irritated and look for making a political announcement or stand out a focus on a cause. \n\n\nCompetitors: Your competitors may cause your site inactive to gain an advantage; or they might screen scratch information on your site, for example, to determine and beat your pricing.\n\n\nOptimizing systems\n\n\nAhead to mitigating the DDoS attacks, the hardware/software systems must be optimized precisely. At software level, consider the following cases for the sake of optimization:\n\n\nThe C10k problem is the problem of optimising network sockets to handle a large number of clients at the same time.\n\n\nOWASP Top Ten Cheat: \n\n\n\nFigure 1: OWASP Top 10 \n\n\nOWASP Mobile security awareness \n\n\n\nFigure 2: OWASP Mobile security\n\n\nAt hardware level, consider the following cases for the sake of optimization:\n\n\nUse loadbalancers to distribute the load of requests. Consider using Round-robin DNS, which returns multiple IP addresses and the user will connect to one of those IP addresses.\nActively check/monitor servers to allow/disallow bots and crawlers. Sometimes, companies that are collecting statistical data about a website/webservice, are sending too many requests that causes performance issues.\n\n\nAttacks in different OSI layers\n\n\nTo understand DDoS attacks, it is wise to abstract down the attacks to the layers of OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. Because the OSI reference model details each phase of the process involved to connect a computer to the network and communication of data, most of the researchers, developers and manufacturers use the OSI model as a common platform to improve network communications.\n\n\nFigure 3: OSI model\n\n\nLayer 7 DDoS attack\n\n\nA Layer 7 DDoS attack is often perpetrated through the use of HTTP GET. The attacker looks like a legitimate connection, and is therefore passed on to the web or application server. The attacker begins requesting large numbers of files/objects using HTTP GET, so the server quickly becomes focused on responding to those requests and has a hard time responding to new, legitimate requests.\n\n\nAn HTTP flood attack is a type of Layer 7 application attack that utilizes the standard valid GET/POST requests used to fetch information, as in typical URL data retrievals (images, information, etc.) during SSL sessions. \nAn HTTP GET/POST flood is a volumetric attack that does not use malformed packets, spoofing or reflection techniques. When rate-limiting was used to stop this type of attack, the bad guys moved to using a distributed system of bots (zombies) to ensure that the requests (attack) was coming from myriad IP addresses and was therefore not only more difficult to detect, but more difficult to stop. \nThe attacker uses malware and trojans to deposit a bot on servers and clients, and then remotely includes them in his attack by instructing the bots to request a list of objects from a specific site or server. The attacker might not use bots, but instead might gather enough evil friends to launch an attack against a site that has annoyed them for some reason. \n\n\nLayer 7 DDoS attacks are more difficult to detect because the TCP connection is valid and so are the requests. Application monitoring is the practice of monitoring software applications using a dedicated set of algorithms, technologies, and approaches to detect zero day and application layer (Layer 7 attacks). Once identified these attacks can be stopped and traced back to a specific source more easily than other types of DDoS attacks. \nLayer 7 firewall (application firewall) gets smarter about stopping layer 7 DDoS attacks without affecting legitimate clients. It is a subtle dance and requires a bit more understanding of the application and its flow, but if implemented correctly it can improve the ability of such devices to detect and prevent layer 7 DDoS attacks from reaching web and application servers and taking a site down.\nDDoS attack involves sending malformed SSL requests to target SSL servers and attempt to exhaust the servers\u2019 resources, and thus deny service from legitimate users. \n\n\nDDoS attack on presentation layer\n\n\nPushdo botnet is an example tool which sends garbage data toward the target SSL server. To mitigate, consider options like offloading the SSL from the origin infrastructure and inspecting the application traffic for signs of attacks traffic or violations of policy at an applications delivery platform (ADP). A good ADP will also ensure that your traffic is then reencrypted and forwarded back to the origin infrastructure with unencrypted content only ever residing in protected memory on a secure bastion host.\n\n\nTelnet communication sniffing is an example of DDoS attack that targets the session layer. The most critical issue in Telnet protocol is the lack of encryption. Every transmission between communicating parties over the network is sent in plain text. Of course, it is a vulnerability in the protocol and being exploited by the attackers for frame sniffing. The attacker can easily sniff the plain information flowing over the network.\n\n\nSYN Flood is an example of attacks that target transport layer. SYN Flood works by establishing half-open connections to a node. When the target receives a SYN packet to an open port, the target will respond with a SYN-ACK and try to establish a connection. However, during a SYN flood, the three-way handshake never completes because the client never responds to the server's SYN-ACK. As a result, these \"connections\" remain in the half-open state until they time out. This causes reaching bandwidth or connection limits of hosts or networking equipment. \n\n\nSYN Flood Mitigation\n\n\nDDoS attack blocking, commonly referred to as blackholing, is a method typically used by ISPs to stop a DDoS attack on one of its customers. This approach to block DDoS attacks makes the site in question completely inaccessible to all traffic, both malicious attack traffic and legitimate user traffic. Blackholing is typically deployed by the ISP to protect other customers on its network from the adverse effects of DDoS attacks such as slow network performance and disrupted service.\n\n\nLayer 3 DDoS Attack\n\n\nLayer 3 infrastructure DDoS attack method uses ICMP messages to overload the targeted network's bandwidth. Attacks on the ICMP protocol, including smurf attacks, ICMP floods, and ping floods. Huge numbers of ICMP requests are sent to the victim's IP address. The source destination IP address is spoofed. The hosts on the victim's network respond to the ICMP requests, which creates a significant amount of traffic on the victim\u2019s network, resulting in consumption of bandwidth and ultimately causing the victim\u2019s server to crash. \n\n\nSmurf attack mitigation\n\n\nTo prevent a smurf attack, individual hosts and routers can be configured to be non-responsive to external ping requests or broadcasts. Routers can also be configured to ensure that packets directed to broadcast addresses are not forwarded.\n\n\nLayer 2 DDoS Attack\n\n\nThe most critical attacks at the data link layer involve Content Address Table (CAM) exhaustion, ARP spoofing, DHCP starvation attacks, MAC address spoofing, VLAN attacks and many more. \nThese attacks generally disrupt the normal traffic flow from sender to receiver. The aim of the MAC Flooding is to takedown this MAC Table. In a typical MAC Flooding attack, the attacker sends Ethernet Frames in a huge number. When sending many Ethernet Frames to the switch, these frames will have various sender addresses. The intention of the attacker is consuming the memory of the switch that is used to store the MAC address table. The MAC addresses of legitimate users will be pushed out of the MAC Table. Now the switch cannot deliver the incoming data to the destination system. So considerable number of incoming frames will be flooded at all ports. MAC Address Table is full and it is unable to save new MAC addresses. It will lead the switch to enter into a fail-open mode and the switch will now behave same way as a network hub. It will forward the incoming data to all ports like a broadcasting. \n\n\nLet\u2019s see what are the benefits of the attacker with the MAC Flooding attack. As the attacker is a part of the network, the attacker will also get the data packets intended for the victim machine. So that the attacker will be able to steal sensitive data from the communication of the victim and other computers. Usually a packet analyzer is used to capture these sensitive data. \nAfter launching a MAC Flood attack successfully, the attacker can also follow up with an ARP spoofing attack. This will help the attacker retaining access to the privileged data even after the attacked switches recover from the MAC Flooding attack. \nThe ARP Spoofing is an attack where the attacker sends falsified ARP Messages (Address Resolution Protocol) so that the attackers MAC address will be linked with the IP address of a legitimated user in the network. \nThe Address Resolution Protocol is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol usually by the IPv4 to map the IP address of a machine to a physical address like MAC address, also called Ethernet address. \n\n\nLayer 2 attack mitigation\n\n\nWe can prevent the MAC Flooding attack with various methods.\nPort Security, switches are configured to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on ports connected to the end stations. Also a small table of \u2018secure\u2019 MAC addresses is maintained with the traditional MAC address table. This table also acts as a subset of the MAC address table. Cisco switches are available with in-built port security system.\n\n\nAuthentication with AAA server, is a server program that handles user requests for access to computer resources and, for an enterprise, provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services.\n\n\nSecurity measures to prevent ARP Spoofing or IP Spoofing\n\n\nImplement IEEE 802.1X suites, will allow packet filtering rules to be installed explicitly by an AAA server based on dynamically learned information about clients, including the MAC address.\n\n\nAttacks on physical layer include physical destruction, obstruction, manipulation and malfunctioning of physical media, which leads to its unavailability to the intended users. It requires the repair to make the physical media resources available.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_of_death\n\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/guide-ddos-defense.html\n\n\nhttps://blog.thousandeyes.com/three-types-ddos-attacks/\n\n\nhttp://ddosattackprotection.org/blog/layer-7-ddos-attack/\n\n\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DDoS%20Quick%20Guide.pdf\n\n\nhttps://devcentral.f5.com/articles/layer-4-vs-layer-7-dos-attack\n\n\nhttps://documentation.meraki.com/MR/Firewall_and_Traffic_Shaping/Layer_3_and_7_Firewall_Processing_Order\n\n\nhttps://security.radware.com/ddos-knowledge-center/ddospedia/ssl-garbage-flood/\n\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642583.2016.1241193\n\n\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642583.2016.1241193?cookieSet=1\n\n\nhttps://www.interserver.net/tips/kb/mac-flooding-prevent/\n\n\nhttp://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/basic_concepts/network_models/osi_model/real_world_example.shtml\n\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten_Cheat_Sheet\n\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/32575924/how-to-stop-hack-dos-attack-on-web-api\n\n\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FzFzOfzb92I/USi8VWXPn9I/AAAAAAAABl8/K9rcqKxpkZE/s1600/OWASP+Top+10+-+2013+-+RC1_Page_07.jpg [Figure 1]\n\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9ijvyGcEjBQ/UM7usnFiTzI/AAAAAAAADpM/0oz23vmAl5k/s1600/OWASP-Top_10_risks.png [Figure 2]\n\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/55/53/bd/5553bdf0a193142af2976db02c4bb920.gif [Figure 3]",

            "text": "A Layer 7 DDoS attack is often perpetrated through the use of HTTP GET. The attacker looks like a legitimate connection, and is therefore passed on to the web or application server. The attacker begins requesting large numbers of files/objects using HTTP GET, so the server quickly becomes focused on responding to those requests and has a hard time responding to new, legitimate requests.  An HTTP flood attack is a type of Layer 7 application attack that utilizes the standard valid GET/POST requests used to fetch information, as in typical URL data retrievals (images, information, etc.) during SSL sessions. \nAn HTTP GET/POST flood is a volumetric attack that does not use malformed packets, spoofing or reflection techniques. When rate-limiting was used to stop this type of attack, the bad guys moved to using a distributed system of bots (zombies) to ensure that the requests (attack) was coming from myriad IP addresses and was therefore not only more difficult to detect, but more difficult to stop. \nThe attacker uses malware and trojans to deposit a bot on servers and clients, and then remotely includes them in his attack by instructing the bots to request a list of objects from a specific site or server. The attacker might not use bots, but instead might gather enough evil friends to launch an attack against a site that has annoyed them for some reason.   Layer 7 DDoS attacks are more difficult to detect because the TCP connection is valid and so are the requests. Application monitoring is the practice of monitoring software applications using a dedicated set of algorithms, technologies, and approaches to detect zero day and application layer (Layer 7 attacks). Once identified these attacks can be stopped and traced back to a specific source more easily than other types of DDoS attacks. \nLayer 7 firewall (application firewall) gets smarter about stopping layer 7 DDoS attacks without affecting legitimate clients. It is a subtle dance and requires a bit more understanding of the application and its flow, but if implemented correctly it can improve the ability of such devices to detect and prevent layer 7 DDoS attacks from reaching web and application servers and taking a site down.\nDDoS attack involves sending malformed SSL requests to target SSL servers and attempt to exhaust the servers\u2019 resources, and thus deny service from legitimate users.",

To mitigate, consider options like offloading the SSL from the origin infrastructure and inspecting the application traffic for signs of attacks traffic or violations of policy at an applications delivery platform (ADP). A good ADP will also ensure that your traffic is then reencrypted and forwarded back to the origin infrastructure with unencrypted content only ever residing in protected memory on a secure bastion host.  Telnet communication sniffing is an example of DDoS attack that targets the session layer. The most critical issue in Telnet protocol is the lack of encryption. Every transmission between communicating parties over the network is sent in plain text. Of course, it is a vulnerability in the protocol and being exploited by the attackers for frame sniffing. The attacker can easily sniff the plain information flowing over the network.  SYN Flood is an example of attacks that target transport layer. SYN Flood works by establishing half-open connections to a node. When the target receives a SYN packet to an open port, the target will respond with a SYN-ACK and try to establish a connection. However, during a SYN flood, the three-way handshake never completes because the client never responds to the server's SYN-ACK. As a result, these \"connections\" remain in the half-open state until they time out. This causes reaching bandwidth or connection limits of hosts or networking equipment.",

ACM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat: [number] Problem Description\n\n\n\n\n[violated Heuristic] [Severity]\n\n\n\n\n[Solution]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDashboard page does not have any Page Title. When user navigates to dashboard from landing page, lack of title can confuse  him/her about the location in the web service.\n    [5, 7][3]\n    Add Page title \"Dashboard\" on the top of the page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen navigated to dashboard, left side menu name appears as \"Analytics\" although user just came to the dashboard page.\n[5, 7][3]\nChange the left side menu option name as Dashboard and add \"Analytics\" as a submenu under Dashboard. When user comes to the page   and expands left side menu, s/he should see both Dashboard and Analytics as focused/hilighted. This would also leave option for   adding new submenus under Dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no help text to explain what are the two charts used for in the Analytics page. User might become confused and frustrated if s/he doesn't know how the charts work.\n[8][2]\nAdd info icon beside chart name and give explanation on the opened dialogues about how the charts work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom chart in the analytics page is named only as \"Chart\". This is not intuitive and user can't understand the purpose of the chart from just a glance at the name or the chart itself.\n[7][3]\nAdd intuitive chart name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn first time logging in to the site, if API ownder doesn't add any API and browses to Dashboard page, the graphs in the analytis appear empty. This might make user confused.\n[8][3]\nBelow the page title or below each individual chart, there should be instructions given to users on how to populate data in both * charts. e.g. \"You have added no API of your own. Please use API Backend to add your API to populate the charts with data.\"        Additional conditions about data appearance can be given via info tip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn clicking API Backend at Side menu, user still remains in the Analytics page (or if clicked from Catalog page). But on clicking other two options user is navigated to the desired page location. This is for the reason of Add API Backend submenu under API Backend.\n[6][3], [2][2]\nDesign the side menu s.t. if there are submenus under any menu option, then on clicking th option, user should be navigated to    the 1st sidemenu page. This also reduces the number of click a user has to make to access sidemenu pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen User doesn't have data populated on charts, selecting anything from filter pane (dropmenus, text box) give a browser alertbox with text. The text to some inconsistency in the table and is not written in a user friendly manner. The meaning might be confusing to the user.\n[4][3]\nFix alert text so that it is more intuitive. If possible, try no to show the text in browser alert window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo information or help text is given about how to use the filtering pane in Analytics page.\n[4][3]\nIn Info tip provide instruction texts about what the filter does and how it should be used. added condtitions (if nay) there for  using the filter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth charts in Analytics have additional portion of their X and Y axises visible when they intersect. Also X axises of both charts break the pane and extends outside.\n[1][3]\nRedraw the axises so that excess portion doesn't appear after intersection between two. Also resize the X axis so that it         doesn't break the pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table for monitoring API calls from different countries doesn't have information about how to use it. Also the title is not intuitive.\n[4][2], [7][3]\nChange the table name into somehting that conveys its purpose. Add info tool tip to provide how the table works and how it is (if so) associated with the world Map below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen no data is available in table, pagination buttons Previous and Next remains below the table, although there is no additional pages to browse.\n[6][2]\nWhen there is no pages to browse the previous and next buttons should not appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the charts are loading for populating data, the \"Loading...\" appears as a text on a table. It is not visible enough.\n[4][2]\nAdd an hourglass with animation to indicate the loading state. This should be all over the website for consistency purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the icons for sorting all over the website, they are not intuitive enough.\n[1][1]\nSimply use a up and down arrow. Down means ascending and Up means descending. It would make it easier to show only these 2        arrows in active/inactive state. clicking on 1 arrow would make it active and another one inactive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen there is no Filtered data, the information on the chart axis doesn't give more context.\n    e.g. Date appear as  Thu04 but does not indicate any month or year. (X axis)\n    Also on Y axis, only number appear. They don't indicate when what are the values for and what is the unit of measurement.\n[1][3]\nAdd axis and chart measurement information on each chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering option is not working at all!!\nSeverity: 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen curser of hover over data on the chart it changes into hand icon, meaning there can be some action. But on clicking the data, nothing happens.\n[1][2]\nIf charts are supposed to be interactive, then fix the functionality because now nothing happens. If they are not interactive,    then cursor should not change into hand icon on pointing over chart data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd option on map to zoom in/out using controls aside from mouse.

In Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces (pp. 199-206). ACM.    Format: [number] Problem Description   [violated Heuristic] [Severity]   [Solution]    Dashboard page does not have any Page Title. When user navigates to dashboard from landing page, lack of title can confuse  him/her about the location in the web service.\n    [5, 7][3]\n    Add Page title \"Dashboard\" on the top of the page    When navigated to dashboard, left side menu name appears as \"Analytics\" although user just came to the dashboard page.\n[5, 7][3]\nChange the left side menu option name as Dashboard and add \"Analytics\" as a submenu under Dashboard. When user comes to the page   and expands left side menu, s/he should see both Dashboard and Analytics as focused/hilighted. This would also leave option for   adding new submenus under Dashboard.    There is no help text to explain what are the two charts used for in the Analytics page. User might become confused and frustrated if s/he doesn't know how the charts work.\n[8][2]\nAdd info icon beside chart name and give explanation on the opened dialogues about how the charts work.    Bottom chart in the analytics page is named only as \"Chart\". This is not intuitive and user can't understand the purpose of the chart from just a glance at the name or the chart itself.\n[7][3]\nAdd intuitive chart name.    On first time logging in to the site, if API ownder doesn't add any API and browses to Dashboard page, the graphs in the analytis appear empty. This might make user confused.\n[8][3]\nBelow the page title or below each individual chart, there should be instructions given to users on how to populate data in both * charts. e.g. \"You have added no API of your own. Please use API Backend to add your API to populate the charts with data.\"        Additional conditions about data appearance can be given via info tip.    On clicking API Backend at Side menu, user still remains in the Analytics page (or if clicked from Catalog page). But on clicking other two options user is navigated to the desired page location. This is for the reason of Add API Backend submenu under API Backend.\n[6][3], [2][2]\nDesign the side menu s.t. if there are submenus under any menu option, then on clicking th option, user should be navigated to    the 1st sidemenu page. This also reduces the number of click a user has to make to access sidemenu pages.    When User doesn't have data populated on charts, selecting anything from filter pane (dropmenus, text box) give a browser alertbox with text. The text to some inconsistency in the table and is not written in a user friendly manner. The meaning might be confusing to the user.\n[4][3]\nFix alert text so that it is more intuitive. If possible, try no to show the text in browser alert window.    No information or help text is given about how to use the filtering pane in Analytics page.\n[4][3]\nIn Info tip provide instruction texts about what the filter does and how it should be used. added condtitions (if nay) there for  using the filter.    Both charts in Analytics have additional portion of their X and Y axises visible when they intersect. Also X axises of both charts break the pane and extends outside.\n[1][3]\nRedraw the axises so that excess portion doesn't appear after intersection between two. Also resize the X axis so that it         doesn't break the pane.    The table for monitoring API calls from different countries doesn't have information about how to use it. Also the title is not intuitive.\n[4][2], [7][3]\nChange the table name into somehting that conveys its purpose. Add info tool tip to provide how the table works and how it is (if so) associated with the world Map below.    When no data is available in table, pagination buttons Previous and Next remains below the table, although there is no additional pages to browse.\n[6][2]\nWhen there is no pages to browse the previous and next buttons should not appear.    When the charts are loading for populating data, the \"Loading...\" appears as a text on a table. It is not visible enough.\n[4][2]\nAdd an hourglass with animation to indicate the loading state. This should be all over the website for consistency purpose    Change the icons for sorting all over the website, they are not intuitive enough.\n[1][1]\nSimply use a up and down arrow. Down means ascending and Up means descending. It would make it easier to show only these 2        arrows in active/inactive state. clicking on 1 arrow would make it active and another one inactive.    When there is no Filtered data, the information on the chart axis doesn't give more context.\n    e.g. Date appear as  Thu04 but does not indicate any month or year. (X axis)\n    Also on Y axis, only number appear. They don't indicate when what are the values for and what is the unit of measurement.\n[1][3]\nAdd axis and chart measurement information on each chart.    Filtering option is not working at all!!\nSeverity: 4    When curser of hover over data on the chart it changes into hand icon, meaning there can be some action. But on clicking the data, nothing happens.\n[1][2]\nIf charts are supposed to be interactive, then fix the functionality because now nothing happens. If they are not interactive,    then cursor should not change into hand icon on pointing over chart data.    Add option on map to zoom in/out using controls aside from mouse. Also navigational control to go north-south-east-west.\n[3][1]    Improve loading time of Map on zooming in/out. When Map is zoomed in in the depth of seeing street details of a city, the zoomed view takes a lot time to load.\n[3][3]    When Analytic page is browsed from up to down using mouse scroller, when cursor comes over map view, instead of page scrolling, map starts to zoom in/out.\n[3][2]\nWhen mouse hovers map, the mouse scrolling should not zoom in/zoom out the map. It should be possible only when map is selected   by specific click.    Redesigning the table \n[1][3]    The focus finder in the overview chart is not visible. User needs to click around the chart to enable it automatically. Any first time user will never know the existence of the focus finder\n[7][3]\nMake the focus finder visible whenever the page is loaded    When focus is changed in the overview chart, in the main chart, it takes a lot of time for the rendering to take place.\nSeverity: 3    Focus finder tool in overview chart is very slow to work.\nSeverity: 2    Remove the background grid from both charts.

New services will arise in the form of payment methods, intelligence on how to better use each one\u2019s savings, and reusing identification capabilities. The main difference will be that we won\u2019t need wallets anymore (eg: Paypal, PingIt) but we\u2019ll simply ask Whatsapp to connect to our bank account and use our fingerprint to accept a payment request from the colleague next door. \n\n\nNo need to open 3 different apps, fiddle with 20+ digit long IBAN codes and double check at the cubicle if the payment arrived alright.\nUnder the new regulation, banks are asked to \u201copen up\u201d, but the burden of developing technical solutions is on the banks themselves, creating the APIs that everyone is talking about. \n\n\nThe main scope of the PSD2 is to encourage new players to enter the payment market, and it does this by mandating banks to \u201copen up the bank account\u201d to external parties. These Third Party Players (TPP) are divided in two types:\n\n\n1) Account Information Service Providers (AISPs)\n\n\n2) Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs)\n\n\nWho gains benefit?\n\n\nAISPs are providers that can connect to bank accounts and retrieve information from them. A typical example of this would be an investment recommendation service: the service will be able to see how much money a user is saving each month from his  income, and provide tailored advice based on his spending patterns.\n\n\nPISPs are players that can initiate payment transactions. This is a radical change in this industry, as currently there are not many payment options that can take money from one\u2019s account and send them elsewhere. Currently we only have (SEPA) Credit Transfers and debit cards, which are both offered only by the account holder\u2019s own bank. In the future we will probably see several different payment options that can move money from the account, without the need of using a wallet (eg: Paypal). The Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) stand to gain the most. The European Banking Authority (EBA) will develop a central register of authorised and registered payment institutions.\n\n\nBenefits in brief:\n\n- competition in the electronic payments market\n- online shopping without the need for a credit card\n- will help lower charges for consumers and ban \"surcharging\" for card payments in the vast majority of cases\n- a better consumer experience\n- better protected against fraud\n\n\nConsumer rights:\n\n- unconditional refund right \n- better protected when the transaction amount is not known in advance\n- sending transfers and money remittances outside the EU or paying in non-EU currencies \n- will oblige Member States to designate competent authorities to handle complaints of payment service users and other interested parties. \n\n\nTime frame and requirements\n\n\nBy January 2018, European banks must provide access to customer information (e.g. account balances and details) to AISPs, introducing another entity to the customer relationship. In addition, banks must expose customer information and payments services to Payment Service Providers (PSPs), dis-intermediating the traditional payments model. Most importantly, banks and financial services institutions may also take on the role of AISPs and PSPs themselves. This will all be enabled through the effective use of APIs; setting the scene for the API economy to play a disruptive role in the future of financial services.\n\n\nThe Open Banking Standard is response to PSD2 requirements. Umbrella organisation is Open Data Institute. \n\n\nIn its report the OB Working Group recommends that:\n- bank data, including information about banks\u2019 products and services, should be made available as open data, so that services can be built allowing customers to get more out of their financial relationships (for example, through product comparison services);\n- open APIs should be created to enable services to be built using bank and customer data. These would include open data about products and services as well as shared data about bank transactions that individuals or businesses can choose to share themselves through secure and controlled means.\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nPSD2 requires payments services providers to implement strong customer authentication  (SCA) when accessing payment accounts online, initiating electronic payments and through remote channels that have a risk of payment fraud. SCA is based on the use of the use of two or more elements that include Knowledge, Possession and Inherence and the authentication mechanism must work in a range of \npayment channels that include web and mobile. \n\n\nAdditionally, transaction details, e.g. payee and transaction amount information, need to be presented to the customer as part of the strong authentication mechanism. This has to be achieved in a manner that supports the \u201cdevelopment of user-friendly, accessible and \ninnovative means of payment\u201d (read APIs).\n\n\nAll the major security related requirements touch us at some level:\n\n\n\n\nMandatory use of \u2018strong customer authentication\u2019: proposing the requirement that (at a minimum) what is known by many as two factor authentication (\u201c2FA\u201d) is carried out for remote / online / electronic payment transactions. \nthis means that if we do the authentication, we must comply to this requirement\n  \n\n\nThe establishment of formal internal security frameworks to assess and report on operational matters expressly including security issues. \nour platform is hosted by our client, what that means here? As SaaS we are affected directly\n\n\nSecurity incident reporting: both to regulators and customers under certain circumstances. \nAs SaaS we are affected directly\n\n\nMandatory security assessment reporting to regulators: on security measures and their effectiveness. \n*As SaaS we are affected directly\n\n\nIncreased role of EBA and ECB: on setting the security protocols, technical standards and policies to be followed in connection with the above obligations. \nwe need to dig these standards from EBA sites and regulations\n \n\n\n\n\nFor auth purposes (open source) https://www.powerauth.com/ seems to be PDS2 compatible and is APIs based auth solution. We probably need to support this kind of extensive auth frameworks or then decide that others handle all authentication. Nevertheless it's clear that all our data (internal too) has to be https.",

New services will arise in the form of payment methods, intelligence on how to better use each one\u2019s savings, and reusing identification capabilities. The main difference will be that we won\u2019t need wallets anymore (eg: Paypal, PingIt) but we\u2019ll simply ask Whatsapp to connect to our bank account and use our fingerprint to accept a payment request from the colleague next door.   No need to open 3 different apps, fiddle with 20+ digit long IBAN codes and double check at the cubicle if the payment arrived alright.\nUnder the new regulation, banks are asked to \u201copen up\u201d, but the burden of developing technical solutions is on the banks themselves, creating the APIs that everyone is talking about.   The main scope of the PSD2 is to encourage new players to enter the payment market, and it does this by mandating banks to \u201copen up the bank account\u201d to external parties. These Third Party Players (TPP) are divided in two types:  1) Account Information Service Providers (AISPs)  2) Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs)",

PISPs are players that can initiate payment transactions. This is a radical change in this industry, as currently there are not many payment options that can take money from one\u2019s account and send them elsewhere. Currently we only have (SEPA) Credit Transfers and debit cards, which are both offered only by the account holder\u2019s own bank.
