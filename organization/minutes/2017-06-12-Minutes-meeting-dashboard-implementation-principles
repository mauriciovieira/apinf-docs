# 2017-06-12 Minutes of meeting about dashboard implementation principles

## Present
Brylie, Nazia, Ilja, Philippe, Matti

As an openning Brylie presented a document about dashboard development scope and purpose.
Name was changed to "Apinf Dashboard".
Brylie proposed the subjects of meeting to be:
* a general discussion about "What dashboard is?".
* a brief about design principles 

Philippe raised a subject: What are user's needs and how to fulfill them?
Brylie presented principles from a book "Data Visualization" by Andy Kirk.
Ilja made a point about dashboard: it should provide information at a glance. He also was concerned whether word 'dashboard' narrows the design options.
Philippe was thinking, that in case users need something else than dashboard, can it be called something else than dashboard.
Brylie said the meeting goal to be define principles for developing dashboard.

Brainstorming about stakeholders. A list was gathered: 
* Organization manager
* API owners
* API consumers
* platform admins
* marketing people
* Apitalists

Discussion about whether a protopersona was needed for every stakeholder.
Discussion about the level of stakeholder expertize affecting the stakeholder needs.
* maybe different views are needed for different stakeholders
* what data each stakeholder would need
* Brainstorming about different types of data needed by different stakeholders.
* perhaps a configurable dashboard, where user is able to give criteria for data or show/hide parts of data

Discussion about constraints:
* resources might be a bottleneck. How to estimate need of developers?
* small group
* use of third party software
* time (1 month = 2 sprints) for basic functionality

Discussion about ways to produce hte dashboard.
Ilja gave an opinion about dashboard in nutshell: information - useful - at a glance - elegant

Nazia: implement at first the basic information and widen the scope later
Ilja: At first evaluation of what can and what can not be implemented because of limitations
Nazia: maybe some kind of evaluation in also needed about other subjects related to dashboard
